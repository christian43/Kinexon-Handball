# Analyse Kinexon Trackingdata

Kinexon is the offical sportdata provider in the first german handball league.
In Kooperation with two german handball clubs and the University Leipzig and
Bergische Universit√§t Wuppertal We first analyse the data from several matches
to provide some insights according player profiles. In a second step we use the
data to describe the physical load and tactical behaviour and may create new
metrics or features. 

All about it is gaining valid informations to a) explain parts of the game and
b) give decison-support to the stackholders of the club.
